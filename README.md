# n8n-nodes-hyperliquid-hip3

This is an n8n community node for trading HIP3 (builder-deployed perpetuals) assets on Hyperliquid.

[n8n](https://n8n.io/) is a workflow automation platform that allows you to connect various services and automate tasks.

[Hyperliquid](https://hyperliquid.xyz) is a decentralized Layer 1 blockchain with fully onchain order books.

[HIP3](https://hyperliquid.gitbook.io/hyperliquid-docs/hyperliquid-improvement-proposals-hips/hip-3-builder-deployed-perpetuals) enables permissionless builder-deployed perpetual markets on Hyperliquid.

```

## Prerequisites

- n8n installed (self-hosted or cloud)
- Hyperliquid wallet with private key
- Understanding of HIP3 asset format: `dex_name:ASSET` (e.g., `xyz:XYZ100`)

## Credentials

This node requires Hyperliquid API credentials with the following information:

- **Private Key**: Your Hyperliquid wallet private key (without 0x prefix)
- **Wallet Address** (optional): Your wallet address (auto-derived if not provided)
- **Network**: Choose between Mainnet or Testnet
- **Vault Address** (optional): If trading on behalf of a vault or subaccount

## Operations

### Place Order
Place a new order on a HIP3 perpetual market.

**Parameters:**
- HIP3 Asset: Asset identifier (e.g., `xyz:XYZ100`)
- Side: Buy (B) or Sell (A)
- Size: Order size
- Order Type: Market or Limit
- Price: Required for limit orders
- Reduce Only: Whether order only reduces position

### Cancel Order

**Parameters:**
- Order ID: The ID of the order to cancel
- Coin: HIP3 asset of the order

### Cancel All Orders
Cancel all orders for a specific HIP3 asset.

**Parameters:**
- HIP3 Asset: Asset to cancel all orders for

### Get Open Orders
Retrieve all open orders for your account.

**Returns:** Array of open orders with details

### Get Positions
Get current HIP3 positions.

**Returns:** Current positions with entry price, size, PnL, etc.

### Get Account Summary
Get account balance and margin information.

**Returns:** Account value, margin used, withdrawable balance

### Get Market Info
Fetch metadata about all HIP3 perpetual dexs.

**Returns:** List of HIP3 dexs with their assets and configuration

### Get Order Book
Retrieve the order book for a specific HIP3 asset.

**Parameters:**
- HIP3 Asset: Asset to get order book for

**Returns:** Bids and asks with prices and sizes

### Get User Fills
Get historical trade fills.

**Parameters:**
- User Address (optional): Address to get fills for (defaults to credential address)

**Returns:** Array of historical fills

## Usage Example

### Basic Trading Workflow

1. **Get Market Info** to see available HIP3 dexs and assets
2. **Get Order Book** to check current prices
3. **Place Order** to enter a position
4. **Get Positions** to monitor your position
5. **Cancel Order** or **Cancel All Orders** if needed

### Example: Automated Trading Bot

```
Trigger (Schedule) → Get Order Book → If (Price Condition) → Place Order → Get Positions
```

## HIP3 Important Notes

### Asset Format
HIP3 assets **must** use the format `dex_name:ASSET`:
- ✅ Correct: `xyz:XYZ100`
- ❌ Wrong: `XYZ100`
- ❌ Wrong: `BTC` (this is standard perp, not HIP3)

### Key Differences from Standard Perpetuals

1. **Isolated Margin Only**: HIP3 markets require isolated margin mode
2. **Higher Fees**: Trading fees are 2x standard perpetuals (protocol still receives same amount)
3. **Custom Oracles**: HIP3 deployers set their own oracle prices
4. **DEX Prefix**: Always include the DEX name prefix (e.g., `xyz:`)
5. **Builder-Deployed**: These are community-created markets, not validator-operated

### Finding HIP3 Assets

Use the **Get Market Info** operation to retrieve all available HIP3 dexs and their assets:

```json
{
  "perpDexs": [
    [null, { "name": "first dex", ... }],
    ["xyz", { "name": "XYZ Dex", "assets": ["XYZ100", "XYZ200"], ... }]
  ]
}
```

The DEX name (e.g., "xyz") is used as the prefix for all assets in that DEX.

## API Endpoints

- **Mainnet**: `https://api.hyperliquid.xyz`
- **Testnet**: `https://api.hyperliquid-testnet.xyz`

## Security Best Practices

⚠️ **Security Warnings:**

1. **Never share your private key** or commit it to version control
2. **Use API Wallets** for production environments when possible
3. **Test on testnet first** before using mainnet
4. **Start with small amounts** when testing live
5. **Monitor your positions** regularly
6. **Understand HIP3 risks** including oracle manipulation and lower liquidity

## Troubleshooting

### "Asset must be in format dex_name:ASSET"
Make sure you're using the HIP3 format with the DEX prefix (e.g., `xyz:XYZ100`), not just the asset name.

### "Could not find mid price"
The asset might not exist or might not have any orders. Check the asset name and verify it exists using **Get Market Info**.

### "Insufficient margin"
Your account doesn't have enough balance. Deposit funds or reduce order size.

### Orders not executing
- For market orders: Check if there's sufficient liquidity
- For limit orders: Verify price is within reasonable bounds
- Ensure you're not in reduce-only mode when trying to increase position
